I obtained the degree of Master of Data Science at the University of Hong Kong, where I have honed my skills in data analysis and machine learning techniques. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), solidifying my foundation in mathematical principles.

My research interests revolve around the application of LLMs and their fine-tuning, particularly in the context of prompt engineering. I am also intrigued by the integration of machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis into software engineering, with a focus on stabilizing AI-driven outputs for production use.

My educational background has equipped me with a strong understanding of mathematics, which serves as the backbone of my academic pursuits.

In terms of practical experiences, I have had the privilege of developing several app demos for external companies leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models). These demos include chatbots with local knowledge bases and automated resume generation. Additionally, I have actively engaged in self-learning Rust to enhance my software development skills and enable the creation of customized features.

During my internship at FOSUN company, I contributed to the data-driven non-invasive glucose monitoring project, utilizing machine learning methods to drive advancements in healthcare. This experience further solidified my expertise in machine learning and deep learning techniques.

In my spare time, I continuously review mathematics and document my findings in comprehensive notebooks. This practice not only reinforces my understanding but also demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and knowledge dissemination.
